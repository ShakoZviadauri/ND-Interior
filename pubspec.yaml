# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
# In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, build-name is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while build-number is used as the build suffix.

# consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

      - assets/images/logo.png
      - assets/images/logo-2.jpg
      - assets/images/welcome-1.jpg

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: NotoSansGeorgian
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/NotoSansGeorgian-Medium.ttf
        - asset: fonts/NotoSansGeorgian-Light.ttf
          style: italic
          weight: 700

    - family: Montserrat-VariableFont
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-VariableFont_wght.ttf
    - family: Montserrat-Italic
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Montserrat-Italic-VariableFont_wght.ttf
    - family: Ubuntu-Bold
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu-Bold.ttf
    - family: Ubuntu-Regular
      fonts:
        - asset: fonts/Ubuntu-Regular.ttf

  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
